# Session-4-Bootstrap

## Brief
Create a homework tracker (it doesnâ€™t have to be functional). Style the index.html page using Bootstrap, with either a navbar or a footer.

## What I did
I used Bootrap columns to help centre the header image and title. I then used Bootstrap's row-columns class to create a table. Within the columns is a text-area to put in the date and a description of the project or test.

## What I learnt
I learnt a lot about combining Bootstrap's CSS and my CSS. Combining the two can create some clashes and I have learnt how to work around those clashes.
